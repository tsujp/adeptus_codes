# Item schemas

Item schemas for different revisions of the game; schemas contain:

- Base (non-cosmetic) and cosmetic items such as weapons, skins, insignias etc.
- For weapons the weapons possible traits and blessings and tiers with values and chances.
- Some information relating to sub-classes (by which abilities relate to class names).
- Strings for item descriptions and ability descriptions.
- Probably more but each schema is about ~237 000 lines of beautified-JSON which is... a lot to manually go through.

Files with suffix `_pretty` have been beautified as they come from the API minified on a single line.

| Revision | Original Filename | Date |

## TODO

- Dates (accurate not just guesses) relating to each revision.
